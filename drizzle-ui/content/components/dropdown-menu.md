title: Dropdown Menu
description: A dropdown menu is a user interface component that allows users to choose one option from a list of choices. It is typically triggered by a button or a similar control and displays a list of options that can be selected.
code: src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx
usage: components/component-demo/dropdown-menu-demo.tsx

The dropdown menu can use the `DropdownMenuList` component to automatically render the dropdown menu from an array, or it can be manually constructed by using the `DropdownMenuGroup`, `DropdownMenuLabel`, and `DropdownMenuItem` components.

The `buttonEl` prop can take either a string or an element like an icon.
