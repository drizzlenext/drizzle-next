# Introduction

Drizzle UI is the minimalist component library used in Drizzle Next and Drizzle Admin. Drizzle UI was inspired by the copy-and-paste approach of shadcn/ui.

shadcn/ui was the original UI solution for Drizzle Next. However, it was decided that Drizzle Next would benefit from having an minimalist version of it's own copy-and-paste component library.

The main objective for Drizzle UI was to create similar components without many of the extra dependencies that were required to use shadcn/ui.

I wanted to reduce dependencies for two reasons. Speed up the build and development process for Drizzle Next. And reduce maintenance overhead of having a large number of external packages.

Drizzle UI is not a replacement for shadcn/ui, radix-ui or any other UI library. It is just a simple starting point for Drizzle Next. You are free to change or add anything you want.

## A Poem for Drizzle UI

In the world of code, where storms may brew,
A gentle drizzle brings a clearer view.
No thunderous clash, no heavy rain,
Just simple drops, to ease the strain.

Drizzle UI, so light and free,
A minimalist's dream, for all to see.
No tangled webs, no complex ties,
Just pure design, beneath clear skies.

With every line, a breeze so light,
It speeds the build, both day and night.
No heavy load, no weight to bear,
Just simple code, with room to spare.

So here's to Drizzle, calm and clear,
A gentle touch, that we hold dear.
In every app, its grace will show,
A drizzle's charm, in every flow.
