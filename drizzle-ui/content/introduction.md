# Introduction

Drizzle UI is the minimalist component library used in Drizzle Next and Drizzle Admin. Drizzle UI was inspired by the copy-and-paste approach of shadcn/ui.

shadcn/ui was the original UI solution for Drizzle Next. However, it was decided that Drizzle Next would benefit from having an minimalist version of it's own copy-and-paste component library.

The main objective for Drizzle UI was to create similar components without many of the extra dependencies that were required to use shadcn/ui.

I wanted to reduce dependencies for two reasons. Speed up the build and development process for Drizzle Next. And reduce maintenance overhead of having a large number of external packages.

Drizzle UI is not a replacement for shadcn/ui, radix-ui or any other UI library. It is just a simple starting point for Drizzle Next. You are free to change or add anything you want.
