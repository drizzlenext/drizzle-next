# Drizzle Util

Drizzle Util is a CLI tool to help you quickly generate Drizzle ORM configuration and schemas.

## Why Drizzle Util?

1. You want to quickly set up Drizzle ORM.
2. You only want to generate the Drizzle ORM scaffolding (without Next.js and Express.js).
3. You want to use the Drizzle ORM scaffolding with another web framework.

## Introduction

Drizzle Util is a command-line tool designed to help you quickly generate scaffolding for Drizzle ORM projects. It streamlines the setup process by automating the creation of configuration files and schemas, making it easier to start building with Drizzle ORM.

Drizzle Util uses the same underlying Drizzle ORM scaffolding logic as Drizzle Next and Drizzle Express.
