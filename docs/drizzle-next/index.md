# Drizzle Next

Drizzle Next is a TypeScript scaffolding web framework.

This CLI Tool generates full-stack Next.js and Drizzle ORM applications.

It includes Drizzle Admin, which turns your Drizzle schema into an admin dashboard.

It also includes Drizzle UI, a collection of customizable components.

## Introduction

Unlike traditional frameworks, Drizzle Next is not installed into your project as a dependency.

Instead, it is a command line interface code generation tool with a focus on keeping dependencies to a minimum.

The generated code is fully customizable as it is written to your project.

Drizzle Admin is an optional dependency if you want an admin dashboard that is automatically generated from your Drizzle schema.

## Why Drizzle Next?

- Curated technology - Minimize decision fatigue with pre-selected libraries.
- Configuration automation - Build immediately with sensible configuration defaults.
- Scaffold automation - Build faster by generating common boilerplate code.
- Admin dashboard - Streamline back-office dashboard development with Drizzle Admin.
- Customizable components - Simplify UI with ready-to-use Drizzle UI components.
