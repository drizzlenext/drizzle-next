# Drizzle Next

Drizzle Next is a full stack Next.js and Drizzle ORM code generation web framework.

## Why Drizzle Next?

1. Curated technology - Minimize decision fatigue with pre-selected libraries.
2. Configuration automation - Build immediately with sensible configuration defaults.
3. Scaffold automation - Build faster by generating common boilerplate code.

## Introduction

This CLI Tool generates full-stack applications built on Next.js and Drizzle ORM.

Unlike traditional frameworks, Drizzle Next is not installed into your project as a dependency.

Instead, it is a command line interface code generation tool with a focus on keeping dependencies to a minimum.

The generated code is fully customizable as it is written to your project.
