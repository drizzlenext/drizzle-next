# Drizzle Express

Drizzle Express is a framework for generating REST APIs built with Express.js and Drizzle ORM.

## Why Drizzle Express?

1. Automated configuration – Start building immediately with sensible defaults.
2. Scaffold automation – Accelerate development by generating common boilerplate code.
3. Standard architecture – Route → Controller → Service → Schema.

## Introduction

Drizzle Express enables rapid REST API development with a CLI tool inspired by Ruby on Rails. Unlike traditional frameworks, it is not installed as a project dependency.

With Drizzle Express, you can generate a complete Express.js API project structure and scaffold resources in minutes. Its configuration defaults and automated scaffolding save setup time and reduce boilerplate.

Drizzle Express follows this standard architecture: Route → Controller → Service → Schema. This approach is scalable, modular, and easy to test.
