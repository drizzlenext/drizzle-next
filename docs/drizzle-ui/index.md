# Drizzle UI

Drizzle UI is a minimalist component library.

## Why Drizzle UI?

1. You want complete control over the styling and implementation of your UI components.
2. You prefer not to rely on or be locked into a third-party UI library.
3. You are looking for an approach similar to shadcn/ui, but with fewer external dependencies to install.

## Introduction

Drizzle UI was developed for use in Drizzle Next and Drizzle Admin.

A copy of Drizzle UI is included in every installation of Drizzle Next and Drizzle Admin.

Drizzle UI can also be used as an installable dependency or copied and pasted into your project.
